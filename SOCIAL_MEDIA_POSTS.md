🚀 Just deployed a production-ready EKS cluster with some cool features!

✨ What I built:
• Amazon EKS with 3 worker nodes
• IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) - no more hardcoded credentials! 🔐
• AWS Secrets Manager integration
• EFS for shared storage
• EBS for persistent data
• CloudWatch monitoring

🛠️ Tech Stack:
• Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
• Helm & Kustomize (App deployment)
• Complete automation with one command!

📚 Everything is documented and open-source!

🎯 Excited to share my latest project: Production-Ready Amazon EKS Cluster with Advanced Security & Storage! 🚀

After weeks of learning and implementation, I've built a complete Infrastructure as Code solution that demonstrates modern cloud-native best practices.

🔑 Key Features:

✅ IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)
   → Secure pod-level AWS permissions without static credentials
   → Automatic credential rotation
   → Full CloudTrail audit trail

✅ AWS Secrets Manager Integration
   → Centralized secret management
   → Mounted as files and environment variables
   → Rotation support built-in

✅ Dual Storage Strategy
   → EFS for shared storage (ReadWriteMany)
   → EBS for persistent data (ReadWriteOnce)
   → Dynamic provisioning with CSI drivers

✅ Complete Observability
   → CloudWatch Container Insights
   → Cluster, node, and pod-level metrics
   → Centralized log aggregation

🛠️ Technology Stack:
• Terraform for infrastructure automation
• Kubernetes 1.31 on Amazon EKS
• Helm & Kustomize for application deployment
• Complete CI/CD ready setup

📊 Architecture Highlights:
• Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
• VPC with public/private subnet architecture
• NAT Gateway for secure outbound connectivity
• Encrypted storage (EFS & EBS)
• Cost-optimized with t3.micro instances

📚 What makes this special?
• 100% Infrastructure as Code
• One-command deployment (~15-20 minutes)
• Comprehensive documentation (8 guides!)
• Production-ready configurations
• Security-first approach

🎓 Learning Outcomes:
This project helped me deep-dive into:
→ Kubernetes security patterns
→ AWS IAM and OIDC integration
→ Storage orchestration in K8s
→ Secrets management best practices
→ Infrastructure automation

💡 The entire codebase is open-source and well-documented - perfect for anyone looking to learn or implement similar solutions!

**Title:** [Project] Production-Ready EKS Cluster with IRSA, Secrets Manager, and Dual Storage

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on a comprehensive EKS deployment and wanted to share it with the community. It's a complete Infrastructure as Code solution that implements several best practices I've learned.

**What it includes:**

- **IRSA Implementation**: Proper IAM Roles for Service Accounts setup with OIDC provider
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager integration using CSI driver
- **Storage**: Both EFS (shared) and EBS (persistent) with dynamic provisioning
- **Observability**: CloudWatch Container Insights for metrics and logs
- **Automation**: Complete Terraform code with Helm and Kustomize

**Why I built this:**

I wanted to create a reference implementation that shows how to properly secure a Kubernetes cluster on AWS without using static credentials. Everything uses IRSA, and secrets are managed centrally.

**What makes it useful:**

- One-command deployment
- Comprehensive documentation (8 different guides)
- Architecture diagrams
- Real-world examples
- Production-ready configurations

**Tech Stack:**
- Kubernetes 1.31
- Terraform
- Helm & Kustomize
- AWS EKS, Secrets Manager, EFS, EBS
